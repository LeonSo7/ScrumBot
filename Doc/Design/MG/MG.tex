\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Overview}
Scrum is an Agile process framework widely used in industry for managing and coordinating collaborative projects. Scrum follows a highly iterative process and often has heavy customer involvement, therefore it can be often be complex. With Discord being a popular communication tool used by many teams of software developers today, ScrumBot provides a solution that directly integrates the management of a scrum development cycle into the communication channels. ScrumBot will allow for better management and organization of retrospectives, stand-ups, and other scrum/agile stages used by software teams within their routine communication channel. ScrumBot will provide features to add and manage Scrum meetings, as well as to store information relevant to those meetings. ScrumBot will also allow Scrum roles to be assigned to members of the Discord channel.

\subsection{Context}
Prior to this document, the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) was created to outline all the functional and non-functional requirements this project must satisfy. The purpose of this document is to provide a high-level structure to the implementation of this project by decomposing the idea into modules. The decomposition into modules enables a clearer form to satisfy the requirements of the project.\\

\noindent The Module Interface Specification was created in parallel to this document. It describes the operations that each module shall perform.\\

\sout{\noindent The Module Guide (MG) is developed \mbox{~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}}. The MG specifies the modular structure of the system and is intended to allow both designers and maintainers to easily identify the parts of the software. The potential readers of this document are as follows:}

\begin{itemize}
\item \sout{New project members: This document can be a guide for a new project member to easily understand the overall structure and quickly find the relevant modules they are searching for.}
\item \sout{Maintainers: The hierarchical structure of the module guide improves the maintainers' understanding when they need to make changes to the system. It is important for a maintainer to update the relevant sections of the document after changes have been made.}
\item \sout{Designers: Once the module guide has been written, it can be used to check for consistency, feasibility and flexibility. Designers can verify the system in various ways, such as consistency among modules, feasibility of the decomposition, and flexibility of the design.}
\end{itemize}

\sout{\noindent The rest of the document is organized as follows. Section \ref{SecChange} lists the anticipated and unlikely changes of the software requirements. Section \ref{SecMH} summarizes the module decomposition that was constructed according to the likely changes. Section \ref{SecConnection} specifies the connections between the software requirements and the modules. Section \ref{SecMD} gives a detailed description of the modules. Section \ref{SecTM} includes two traceability matrices. One checks the completeness of the design against the requirements provided in the SRS. The other shows the relation between anticipated changes and the modules. Section \ref{SecUse} describes the use relation between modules.}

\textcolor{red}{The Module Guide describes the structure of the system and identifies the system components as modules. The Module Guide's focus is on the hierarchy of the system modules, and not the functionality of each component. The potential readers of this document include: new project members, project maintainers, and designers.}\\

\textcolor{red}{This project is organized as follows. Section \ref{SecChange} contains a list of anticipated and unlikely changes that may occur to the system design. Section \ref{SecMH} contains a overview of the module hierarchy. Section \ref{SecConnection} contains a list of connections between the SRS and the modules. Section \ref{SecMD} contains a description of each module. Section \ref{SecTM} contains two traceability matrices; one for the connections between the SRS and the modules, and another for the connections between the anticipated changes and the modules. Section \ref{SecUse} depicts the uses relation among all the modules.}

\subsection{Design Principles}
% Copied from template
\sout{Decomposing a system into modules is a commonly accepted approach to developing software. The Module Guide (MG) developed by \mbox{\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}} specified the modular structure of the system. A module is a work assignment for a programmer or programming team \mbox{~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}}. Decomposition of the system into modules is based on the principle of information hiding \mbox{~\citep{Parnas1972a}}. This principle supports design for change, because the ``secrets'' that each module hides represent likely future changes. Design for change is valuable in SC, where modifications are frequent, especially during initial development as the solution space is explored.}\\

\textcolor{red}{Decomposition of the system into modules is based on the principle of information hiding \mbox{~\citep{Parnas1972a}}. Each module shall contain/hide a secret that can be easily changed. This supports the idea of design for change.}\\

The design follows the rules layed out by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}, as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item System details that are likely to change independently should be the
  secrets of separate modules.
\item Each data structure is used in only one module.
\item Any other program that requires information stored in a module's data
  structures must obtain it by calling access programs belonging to that module.
\end{itemize}

\section{Anticipated and Unlikely Changes} \label{SecChange}

\sout{This section lists possible changes to the system. According to the likeliness of the change, the possible changes are classified into two categories. Anticipated changes are listed in Section \ref{SecAchange}, and unlikely changes are listed in Section \ref{SecUchange}.}

\subsection{Anticipated Changes} \label{SecAchange}
\sout{Anticipated changes are the source of the information that is to be hidden inside the modules. Ideally, changing one of the anticipated changes will only require changing the one module that hides the associated decision. The approach adapted here is called design for change.}

\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acInput1}:] \sout{The format of input data}
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acInput2}:] The format of discord commands
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acServer1}:] The URL used to connect to the hosting server
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acServer2}:] The format of the response from the server
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acOutput}:] The format of the output data
\end{description}

\subsection{Unlikely Changes} \label{SecUchange}

\sout{The module design should be as general as possible. However, a general system is more complex. Sometimes this complexity is not necessary. Fixing some design decisions at the system architecture stage can simplify the software design. If these decision should later need to be changed, then many parts of the design will potentially need to be modified. Hence, it is not intended that these decisions will be changed.}

\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucInput}:] There will always be a source of input data external to the software
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucInput}:] The system will be interfacing with the Discord application
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucInput}:] The data structure of a meeting
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucInput}:] The data structure of a project
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucInput}:] The data structure of a task
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucInput}:] The data structure of a sprint
\end{description}

\section{Module Hierarchy} \label{SecMH}
\sout{This section provides an overview of the module design. Modules are summarized in a hierarchy decomposed by secrets in Table \ref{TblMH}. The modules listed below, which are leaves in the hierarchy tree, are the modules that will actually be implemented.}

\section{Connection Between Requirements and Design} \label{SecConnection}

\sout{The design of the system is intended to satisfy the requirements developed in the SRS. In this stage, the system is decomposed into modules. The connection between requirements and modules is listed in Table \ref{TblRT}.}
\textcolor{red}{The SRS defines the requirements that the system design must fulfill. In Table \ref{TblRT}, the connections between the requirements and modules are listed.}

\section{Module Decomposition} \label{SecMD}
\sout{Modules are decomposed according to the principle of ``information hiding'' proposed by \mbox{\citet{ParnasEtAl1984}}. The \emph{Secrets} field in a module decomposition is a brief statement of the design decision hidden by the module. The \emph{Services} field specifies \emph{what} the module will do without documenting \emph{how} to do it. For each module, a suggestion for the implementing software is given under the \emph{Implemented By} title. If the entry is \emph{OS}, this means that the module is provided by the operating system or by standard programming language libraries.  Also indicate if the module will be implemented specifically for the software.}

\sout{Only the leaf modules in the hierarchy have to be implemented. If a dash (\emph{--}) is shown, this means that the module is not a leaf and will not have to be implemented. Whether or not this module is implemented depends on the programming language selected.}

\subsection{Hardware Hiding Modules (\mref{m1})}

\section{Use Hierarchy Between Modules} \label{SecUse}

\sout{In this section, the uses hierarchy between modules is provided. \mbox{\citet{Parnas1978}} said of two programs A and B that A {\em uses} B if correct execution of B may be necessary for A to complete the task described in its specification. That is, A {\em uses} B if there exist situations in which the correct functioning of A depends upon the availability of a correct implementation of B.}
Figure \ref{FigUH} illustrates the use relation between the modules. It can be seen that the graph is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Each level of the hierarchy offers a testable and usable subset of the system, and modules in the higher level of the hierarchy are essentially simpler because they use modules from the lower levels.
