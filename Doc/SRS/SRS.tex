This document describes the requirements for Scrumbot.  The template for the Software
Requirements Specification (SRS) is a subset of the Volere.
template~\citep{RobertsonAndRobertson2012}.  If you make further modifications
to the template, you should explicitly state what modifications were made.

\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}

\subsection{The Stakeholders}
This solution will be used in an environment where the development team uses the scrum agile framework and uses Discord as their routine communication channel.
\subsubsection{Roles in Scrum process}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Product Owner(s)
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[] The product owner(s) will benefit from the reduced development time through improved communication and efficient management of the project. The product owner(s) will also benefit as their ideas and requirements will be better organized, thus helping the development team more efficiently achieve the goals of the product owner(s).
    \end{itemize}
    \item Scrum Master
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[] The scrum master will be better able to coordinate scrum plans and division of tasks, as well as routine communication (i.e. retrospectives and stand-ups). With a scrum management system directly implemented into the communication channels, the scrum master will be able to directly manage the meeting information and their scrum development cycle during communication.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Development Team
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[] The development team will be able to more easily follow through on tasks assigned by the scrum master. The development team may easily refer to any relevant articles or information regarding their project. This will reduce inefficiencies and speedup communication within the development team. It will also reduce confusion, as all information concerning the development cycle will be available through their routine communication channel (Discord).
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Other stakeholders}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Development Firm
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[] The development firm will benefit through centralizing project resources, therefore improving the organization and management of the project. The development firm will therefore be able to reduce any costs associated with inefficiencies during the development process. This will also improve communication between members of the development firm.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{The Client}

\subsubsection{The Customers}

\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}

\subsection{Mandated Constraints}

\subsection{Naming Conventions and Terminology}

\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}

User characteristics should go under assumptions.

\section{Functional Requirements}

\subsection{The Scope of the Work and the Product}

\subsubsection{The Context of the Work}

\subsubsection{Work Partitioning}

\subsubsection{Individual Product Use Cases}

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

\section{Non-functional Requirements}

\subsection{Look and Feel Requirements}

\subsection{Usability and Humanity Requirements}

\subsection{Performance Requirements}

\subsection{Operational and Environmental Requirements}

\subsection{Maintainability and Support Requirements}

\subsection{Security Requirements}

\subsection{Cultural Requirements}

\subsection{Legal Requirements}

\subsection{Health and Safety Requirements}

This section is not in the original Volere template, but health and safety are
issues that should be considered for every engineering project.

\section{Project Issues}

\subsection{Open Issues}

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}

\subsection{New Problems}

\subsection{Tasks}

\subsection{Migration to the New Product}

\subsection{Risks}

\subsection{Costs}

\subsection{User Documentation and Training}

\subsection{Waiting Room}

\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}

\bibliographystyle{plainnat}

\bibliography{SRS}

\newpage

\section{Appendix}

This section has been added to the Volere template.  This is where you can place
additional information.

\subsection{Symbolic Parameters}

The definition of the requirements will likely call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS.
Their values are defined in this section for easy maintenance.
