This document describes the requirements for Scrumbot.  The template for the Software
Requirements Specification (SRS) is a subset of the Volere.
template~\citep{RobertsonAndRobertson2012}.  If you make further modifications
to the template, you should explicitly state what modifications were made.

\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
Scrum is an agile process framework widely used in industry for managing and coordinating collaborative projects. Scrum being a process based on the agile development method, follows a highly iterative process and often has heavy customer involvement, therefore it can be often be complex. It is often difficult to manage communication and coordination within the project due to the complexity of agile development processes. With Discord being a popular communication tool used by many teams of software developers today, Scrumbot provides a solution that directly integrates the management of a scrum development cycle into the communication channels. Scrumbot will allow for better management and organization of retrospectives, stand-ups, and other scrum/agile processes used by software teams during routine communication.\\

As a result, Scrumbot, a well-integrated scrum management system, can reduce inefficiencies surrounding the management of projects using the scrum framework, as well as strengthen communication within the agile process. This will help software development firms reduce costs and achieve better workflow.

\subsection{The Stakeholders}
This solution will be used in an environment where the development team uses the scrum agile framework and uses Discord as their routine communication channel.
\subsubsection{The Client}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dr. Ashgar Bokhari (3XA3)
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[] The client for this project is Dr. Ashgar Bokhari - professor of the 3XA3 course.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{The Customer}
The customer of the ScrumBot is any firm looking to improve efficiency in communication and organization during the Scrum process of an agile software development cycle using the Scrum framework. This customer will likely be a software development firm (or the development department of a firm).
\begin{itemize}
    \item Software Development Firm
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[] The development firm will benefit through centralizing project resources, therefore improving the organization and management of the project. The development firm will therefore be able to reduce any costs associated with inefficiencies during the development process. This will also improve communication between members of the development firm.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{The Users (Roles in Scrum process)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Product Owner(s)
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[] The product owner(s) will benefit from the reduced development time through improved communication and efficient management of the project. The product owner(s) will also benefit as their ideas and requirements will be better organized, thus helping the development team more efficiently achieve the goals of the product owner(s).
    \end{itemize}
    \item Scrum Master
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[] The scrum master will be better able to coordinate scrum plans and division of tasks, as well as routine communication (i.e. retrospectives and stand-ups). With a scrum management system directly implemented into the communication channels, the scrum master will be able to directly manage the meeting information and their scrum development cycle during communication.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Development Team
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[] The development team will be able to more easily follow through on tasks assigned by the scrum master. The development team may easily refer to any relevant articles or information regarding their project. This will reduce inefficiencies and speedup communication within the development team. It will also reduce confusion, as all information concerning the development cycle will be available through their routine communication channel (Discord).
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Other stakeholders}


\subsection{Mandated Constraints}
\subsubsection{Solution Constraints}

\subsubsection{Implementation Environment of the Current System}
The application will be be installed on the user's local machine or a server, and added to a Discord server. To function, the application be started on the machine and the user will interact with it through the respective Discord server.

\subsubsection{Partner or Collaborative Applications}

\subsubsection{Off-the-Shelf Software}
The following off-the-shelf software will utilized:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Discord (Available at \url{https://discordapp.com/})
    \item Discord Server (Available through Discord)
    \item Python 3 (Available at \url{https://www.python.org/downloads/})
    \item discord.py (Available at \url{https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/})
\end{itemize}
All off-the-shelf software are available for free.

\subsubsection{Anticipated Workplace Environment}
The anticipated workplace environment for this application is within a software development team's Discord server. This application can be used from anywhere, as long as the user has access to the respective Discord server.

\subsubsection{Schedule Constraints}
The project deliverable must completed by their respective deadline. The remaining deadline include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Proof of Concept (February 13, 2020, 1:00 PM)

    \item Demonstration, Revision 1 (March 31, 2020)
    \item Final Documentation, Revision 1 (April 6, 2020, 11:30 PM)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Budget Constraints}
This project has no monetary budget. If there are any necessary purchases for development, the cost shall be paid by the project members. All resources to re-create and upgrade the existing project are provided.
