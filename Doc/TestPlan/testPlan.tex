\section{General Information}

\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to outline the testing, validation, and verification process of the functional and non-functional requirements, for the ScrumBot project. These test cases were conceived before the implementation and therefore will be used by the project members for future reference during the development process.

\subsection{Scope}
% The test plan outlines all tests which will be conducted during this project, and the testing tools that will be used.

\subsection{Overview of Document}
% How we are testing
This document outlines a test plan that fully encompasses all requirements of ScrumBot, as stated in the SRS. This document includes relevant information concerning: test team, automated testing, testing tools, testing schedule, unit-testing, and test cases.

\section{Plan}
\subsection{Software Description}
Scrum is an Agile process framework widely used in industry for managing and coordinating collaborative projects. Scrum being a process based on the agile development method, follows a highly iterative process and often has heavy customer involvement, therefore it can be often be complex. With Discord being a popular communication tool used by many teams of software developers today, ScrumBot provides a solution that directly integrates the management of a scrum development cycle into the communication channels. ScrumBot will allow for better management and organization of retrospectives, stand-ups, and other scrum/agile stages used by software teams within their routine communication channel.

\subsection{Test Team}
The test team will consist of all the members of the project: Arkin Modi, Leon So, and Timothy Choy.

\subsection{Automated Testing Approach}
Testing shall be automated with the use of the GitLab's CI/CD tool. The tests will be run every time a commit is pushed to the repository.

\subsection{Testing Tools}
The unit tests will be written using the Pytest framework. Static testing will be done with the use of Pylint.

\subsection{Testing Schedule}
See Gantt Chart at the following url, \url{https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/modia1/ScrumBot/-/blob/master/ProjectSchedule/}.

\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation} 
N/A

\section{Unit Testing Plan}
Unit testing will be performed through the use of the Pytest testing framework.

\subsection{Unit testing of internal functions}
Unit testing of internal functions will be performed for every function to ensure robustness. These tests will consist of a combination of partition testing and fuzz testing. Through this, verifying that the functions react in a predictable way. Following this, the functions will then undergo integration testing, to verify the compliance of the system with the SRS. During integration testing, stubs and drivers will be created as needed. For the testing of internal functions, the team will aim for a coverage of at minimum 85\%.

\subsection{Unit testing of output files}       
The only output file will be the application executable, which shall be tested for correctness as a whole as well as the fulfillment of the SRS. This testing will take the form of system testing and acceptance testing. The system testing will test the performance, the behavior under extreme/varying load, and scalability with the number of users. The acceptance testing will ensure the SRS has been fulfilled.
