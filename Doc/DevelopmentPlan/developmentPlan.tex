\section{Team Meeting Plan}
% When, Where, Frequency, Roles, Rules for Agenda
Meetings will primarily take place within the course's two lab session each week. If necessary, the Project Lead will schedule any additional meeting outside of course time with the consent of all team members. The time and location will be decided by the Project Lead at the time of scheduling. 
\\\\
\noindent For each meeting, the role each member will play is as described in the Team Member Roles section.

\section{Team Communication Plan}
% Facebook Messenger, GitLab Issues, Gantt Chart
Communication outside of class with predominantly be done through Facebook Messenger. Through Facebook Messenger, we will communicate any problems and inquires. The Gantt Chart will be used to keep track of the progress of all aspects of the project as well as plan out future work on a high level. Additionally, GitLab's issues feature will be used in parallel to the Gantt Chart to organize work assignment, deadlines, and work status (i.e. not started, in-progress, and completed).
