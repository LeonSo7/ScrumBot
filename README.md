Team Name: ScrumBot

Team Members: Timothy Choy, Arkin Modi, Leon So

This project is a remastering of a Discord meeting bot.

Brief Description:
Scrum is an agile process framework widely used in industry for managing and coordinating collaborative projects. Scrum being a process based on the agile development method, follows a highly iterative process and often has heavy customer involvement, therefore it can be often be complex. It is often difficult to manage communication and coordination within the project due to the complexity of agile development processes. With Discord being a popular communication tool used by many teams of software developers today, our team would like to develop a solution to directly integrate the management of a scrum development cycle into the communication channels. Our solution will allow for better management and organization of retrospectives, stand-ups, and other scrum/agile processes used by software teams during routine communication.
